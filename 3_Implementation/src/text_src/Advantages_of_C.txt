		  1. As a middle level language, C combines the features of both high level and low level languages. 
		     It can be used for low-level programming, such as scripting for drivers and kernels and it also 
			 supports functions of high level programming languages, such as scripting for software applications
			 etc.
					  
          2. C is a structured programming language which allows a complex program to be broken into simpler 
			 programs called functions. It also allows free movement of data across these functions.
                      
		  3. C language is case-sensitive.
					 
          4. C is highly portable and is used for scripting system applications which form a major part of 
       	     Windows, UNIX and Linux operating system.
					 
		  5. C is a general purpose programming language and can efficiently work on enterprise applications,
		     games, graphics, and applications requiring calculations.
                       
		  6. C language has a rich library which provides a number of built-in functions. It also offers dynamic
			 memory allocation.
