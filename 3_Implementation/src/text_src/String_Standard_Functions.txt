									String Standard function
									
    The <string.h> Standard Header[edit]
    Because programmers find raw strings cumbersome to deal with, they wrote the code in the <string.h> library.
    It represents not a concerted design effort but rather the accretion of contributions made by various
    authors over a span of years.
    First, three types of functions exist in the string library:
    the mem functions manipulate sequences of arbitrary characters without regard to the null character;
	the str functions manipulate null-terminated sequences of characters;
	the strn functions manipulate sequences of non-null characters.
    The more commonly-used string functions[edit]
	The nine most commonly used functions in the string library are:
	strcat - concatenate two strings
	strchr - string scanning operation
	strcmp - compare two strings
	strcpy - copy a string
	strlen - get string length
	strncat - concatenate one string with part of another
	strncmp - compare parts of two strings
	strncpy - copy part of a string
	strrchr - string scanning operation

	The less commonly-used string functions[edit]
	The less-used functions are:
	memchr - Find a byte in memory
	memcmp - Compare bytes in memory
	memcpy - Copy bytes in memory
	memmove - Copy bytes in memory with overlapping areas
	memset - Set bytes in memory
	strcoll - Compare bytes according to a locale-specific collating sequence
	strcspn - Get the length of a complementary substring
	strerror - Get error message
	strpbrk - Scan a string for a byte
	strspn - Get the length of a substring
	strstr - Find a substring
	strtok - Split a string into tokens
	strxfrm - Transform string
