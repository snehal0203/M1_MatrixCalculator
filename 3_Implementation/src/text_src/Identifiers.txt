									Identifiers
			
	Identifiers are used as the general terminology for the names of variables, functions and arrays.
	These are user defined names consisting of arbitrarily long sequence of letters and digits with 
	either a letter or the underscore(_) as a first character.
    There are certain rules that should be followed while naming  c identifiers:
    
   1. They must begin with a letter or underscore(_).
   2. They must consist of only letters, digits, or underscore. No other special character is allowed.
   3. It should not be a keyword.
   4. It must not contain white space.
   5. It should be up to 31 characters long as only first 31 characters are significant.
   Some examples of c identifiers:

   Name	      -  Remark
   A9	      -  Valid
   Temp.var	  -  Invalid as it contains special character other than the underscore
   void	      -  Invalid as it is a keyword
