									One Dimensional Array
									
     The declaration form of one dimensional array is
     Data_type array_name [size];
     The following declares an array called ‘numbers’ to hold 5 integers and 
	 sets the first and last elements. C arrays are always indexed from 0. So
	 the first integer in ‘numbers’ array is numbers[0] and the last is numbers[4].

     int numbers [5];
     numbers [0] = 1;       // set first element
     numbers [4] = 5;       // set last element
    This array contains 5 elements. Any one of these elements may be referred to by
    giving the name of the array followed by the position number of the particular 
	element in square brackets ([]). The first element in every array is the zeroth
	element.Thus, the first element of array ‘numbers’is referred to asnumbers[ 0 ],
	the second element of array ‘numbers’is referred to as numbers[ 1 ], the fifth
    element of array ‘numbers’is referred to as numbers[ 4 ], and, in general, the
    n-th element of array ‘numbers’is referred to as numbers[ n – 1 ].
    C – 1D ARRAY EXAMPLE PROGRAM :


    #include<stdio.h>
    #include<conio.h>
    int main()
    {
   int i,number[5];
   clrscr();
   printf(“Enter 5 number \n”);
   for(i=0;i<5;i++)
	scanf(“%d”,&numbers[i]);
	printf(“Array elements are \n”);
	for(i=0;i<5;i++)
	printf(“%d\n”,numbers[i]);
	getch();
	return 0;
	}
