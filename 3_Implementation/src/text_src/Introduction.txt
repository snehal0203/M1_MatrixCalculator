                                               Introduction To C
					
    Software is a collection of programs and a program is a collection of instructions given to the computer. 
    Development of software is a stepwise process. Before developing a software, number of processes are done.
    The first is to understand the user requirements. Problem analysis arises during the requirement phase of 
    software develpoment. Problem analysis is done for obtaining the user requirements and to determine the 
    and output of the program.

    For solving the problem, an "algorithm" is implemented. Algorithm is a seqence of steps that gives method
    of solving a problem. This "algorithm" creates the logic of program. On the basis of this "algorithm", 
    program code is written. The steps before writing program code are as-
                                   
        User requirements >> Problem analysis >> Input and Output >> Designing algorithm >> Program coding
