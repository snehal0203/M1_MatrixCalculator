								Commonly Used Library Functions
		
    Some of the "commands" in C are not really "commands" at all but are functions.
	For example, we have been using printf and scanf to do input and output, and
    we have used rand to generate random numbers - all three are functions.
    There are a great many standard functions that are included with C compilers and
    while these are not really part of the language, in the sense that you can re-write
    them if you really want to, most C programmers think of them as fixtures and fittings.
    Later in the course we will look into the mysteries of how C gains access to these 
	standard functions and how we can extend the range of the standard library. But for
    now a list of the most common libraries and a brief description of the most useful 
	functions they contain follows:

    stdio.h: I/O functions:
    getchar() returns the next character typed on the keyboard.
    putchar() outputs a single character to the screen.
    printf() as previously described
    scanf() as previously described
    string.h: String functions
    strcat() concatenates a copy of str2 to str1
    strcmp() compares two strings
    strcpy() copys contents of str2 to str1
    ctype.h: Character functions
    isdigit() returns non-0 if arg is digit 0 to 9
    isalpha() returns non-0 if arg is a letter of the alphabet
    isalnum() returns non-0 if arg is a letter or digit
    islower() returns non-0 if arg is lowercase letter
    isupper() returns non-0 if arg is uppercase letter
    math.h: Mathematics functions
    acos() returns arc cosine of arg
    asin() returns arc sine of arg
    atan() returns arc tangent of arg
    cos() returns cosine of arg
    exp() returns natural logarithim e
    fabs() returns absolute value of num
    sqrt() returns square root of num
    time.h: Time and Date functions
    time() returns current calender time of system
    difftime() returns difference in secs between two times
    clock() returns number of system clock cycles since program execution
    stdlib.h:Miscellaneous functions
    malloc() provides dynamic memory allocation, covered in future sections
    rand() as already described previously
    srand() used to set the starting point for rand()
