											Array Terminology
											
   Terminology:rank- the number of dimensions up to and including 7 dimensions.
    A has rank 1, B, C and D have rank 2.
    bounds -- upper and lower limits of indices, an unspecified bound is 1.
    A has lower bound 1 and upper bound 15, B has lower bounds -4 and 0 and
    upper bounds 0 and 2, C has lower bounds of 1 and 1 with upper bounds 5
	 and 3, and D has bounds 0 and 0, and 4 and 2.
    extent -- number of elements in dimension (which can be zero). A has extent 
	15, B, C and D have extents 5 and 3.
    size -- either the total number of elements or, if particular dimension is 
	specified, the number of elements in that dimension. All arrays have size 15.
    shape -- rank and extents. A has shape (/15/), B, C and D have shape (/5,3/).
    conformable -- two arrays are conformable if they have the same shape -- for
	 operations between two arrays the shapes (of the sections) must (generally)
	  conform (just like in mathematics). B, C and D have the same shape so they conform.
    there is no storage associationgif for Fortran 90 arrays.
    Explicit-shape arrays can have symbolic bounds so long as they are initialisation
	 expressions -- evaluatable at compile time.
    Consider the following declarations,

    REAL, DIMENSION(15)       :: A
    REAL, DIMENSION(-4:0,0:2) :: B
    REAL  :: C(5,3), D(0:4,0:2) ! Shorthand
    Individual array elements are denoted by subscripting the array name by an INTEGER, 
	for example, A(7)  tex2html_wrap_inline22840 element of A, or C(3,2), 3 elements down, 2 across.
