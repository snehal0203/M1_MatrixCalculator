										The If and Else Statements
										
    An if statement can be followed by an optional else statement, which executes when 
	the Boolean expression is false.
    Syntax
    
    The syntax of an if...else statement in C programming language is -
    if(boolean_expression) {
    /* statement(s) will execute if the boolean expression is true */
    } else {
    /* statement(s) will execute if the boolean expression is false */
    }
    If the Boolean expression evaluates to true, then the if block will be executed, 
	otherwise, the else block will be executed.

    C programming language assumes any non-zero and non-null values as true, and 
	if it is either zero or null, then it is assumed as false value.

     Example
 
     #include <stdio.h>
 
     int main () {

     /* local variable definition */
     int a = 100;
 
     /* check the boolean condition */
     if( a < 20 ) {
      /* if condition is true then print the following */
      printf("a is less than 20\n" );
      } else {
      /* if condition is false then print the following */
      printf("a is not less than 20\n" );
      }
   
      printf("value of a is : %d\n", a);
 
      return 0;
      }
      When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result -

      a is not less than 20;
      value of a is : 100
