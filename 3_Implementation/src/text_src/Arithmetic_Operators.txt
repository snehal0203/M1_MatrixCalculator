										Arithmetic Operations
										
    The following table shows all the arithmetic operators supported by the C language.
    Assume variable A holds 10 and variable B holds 20, then -

  Operator	  Description	                           Example
   +	      Adds two operands.                       A + B = 30
   -	      Subtracts second operand from the first. A - B = -10
   *	      Multiplies both operands.	               A * B = 200
   /	      Divides numerator by de-numerator.	   B / A = 2
  %        	  Modulus Operator and remainder of after an integer division.	B % A = 0
  ++	     Increment operator increases the integer value by one.	        A++ = 11
  --	     Decrement operator decreases the integer value by one.	        A-- = 9
    Example
    Try the following example to understand all the arithmetic operators available in C -

 
   #include <stdio.h>

   main() {

   int a = 21;
   int b = 10;
   int c ;

   c = a + b;
   printf("Line 1 - Value of c is %d\n", c );
	
   c = a - b;
   printf("Line 2 - Value of c is %d\n", c );
	
   c = a * b;
   printf("Line 3 - Value of c is %d\n", c );
	
   c = a / b;
   printf("Line 4 - Value of c is %d\n", c );
	
   c = a % b;
   printf("Line 5 - Value of c is %d\n", c );
	
   c = a++; 
   printf("Line 6 - Value of c is %d\n", c );
	
   c = a--; 
   printf("Line 7 - Value of c is %d\n", c );
}
