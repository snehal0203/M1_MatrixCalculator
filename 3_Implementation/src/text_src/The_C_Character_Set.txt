      character:- It denotes any alphabet, digit or special symbol used to represent information. 
      
	  Use:- These characters can be combined to form variables. C uses constants, variables, 
	        operators, keywords and expressions as building blocks to form a basic C program. 

      Character set:- The character set is the fundamental raw material of any language and 
	                  they are used to represent information. Like natural languages, computer
					  language will also have well defined character set, which is useful to
					  build the programs. 

      The characters in C are grouped into the following two categories:

       1.  Source character set
            a. Alphabets
            b. Digits
            c. Special Characters
            d. White Spaces

       2.   Execution character set
            a. Escape Sequence

        Source character set

             ALPHABETS
            Uppercase letters                 A-Z
            Lowercase letters                 a-z

          DIGITS     0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
