										While and Do while Loop
										
           while loop
          The syntax of a while loop is:
          while (testExpression) 
           {
         //codes 
           }
          where, testExpression checks the condition is true or false before each loop.  
         How while loop works?
         The while loop evaluates the test expression.
          If the test expression is true (nonzero), codes inside the body of while loop
		  are exectued. The test expression is evaluated again. The process goes on until 
		  the test expression is false.
         When the test expression is false, the while loop is terminated.
         Example #1: while loop
        // Program to find factorial of a number
       // For a positive integer n, factorial = 1*2*3...n
      #include <stdio.h>
      int main()
      {
      int number;
      long long factorial;
      printf("Enter an integer: ");
      scanf("%d",&number);

      factorial = 1;

     // loop terminates when number is less than or equal to 0
     while (number > 0)
     {
        factorial *= number;  // factorial = factorial*number;
        --number;
     }

     printf("Factorial= %lld", factorial);

    return 0;
     }

 
   Output

   Enter an integer: 5
   Factorial = 120

    nonzero (true) and 0 (false)), check out relational and logical operators.

   do...while loop
   The do..while loop is similar to the while loop with one important difference.
    The body of do...while loop is executed once, before checking the test expression. 
	Hence, the do...while loop is executed at least once.

   do...while loop Syntax
   do
   {
   // codes
   }
   while (testExpression);
   How do...while loop works?
   The code block (loop body) inside the braces is executed once.
   Then, the test expression is evaluated. If the test expression is true, the loop body
    is executed again. This process goes on until the test expression is evaluated to 0 (false).

   When the test expression is false (nonzero), the do...while loop is terminated.

   Example #2: do...while loop
   // Program to add numbers until user enters zero

  #include <stdio.h>
  int main()
  {
    double number, sum = 0;

    // loop body is executed at least once
    do
    {
        printf("Enter a number: ");
        scanf("%lf", &number);
        sum += number;
    }
    while(number != 0.0);

    printf("Sum = %.2lf",sum);

    return 0;
   }
   Output

Enter a number: 1.5
Enter a number: 2.4
Enter a number: -3.4
Enter a number: 4.2
Enter a number: 0
Sum = 4.70
