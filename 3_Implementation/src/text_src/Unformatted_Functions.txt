	 those that can deal with a single character and those that can deal with a
	 string of characters. The various unformatted input/output functions in C.
     Unformatted Input/Output Functions with Example: C Language
     getchar( ) and putchar( )

     Even though getchar( ) and putchar( ) looks like functions, they are not.
	 They are the macros that are used to read and display a character. 
	 The syntax to read a character shown below:
     “ch = getchar( )” will reads a character from the keyboard and copy it 
	 into memory area which is identified by the variable ch. No arguments 
	 are required for this macro. Once the character is entered from the keyboard,
	 the user has to press Enter key.
     “putchar(ch)” outputs a character stored in a variable on the monitor.
	  The variable should be passed as parameter as shown in the above syntax.


                                main()
                                {
                                char ch;
                                clrscr();
                                ch = getchar();
                                putchar(ch);
                                getch();
                                }
